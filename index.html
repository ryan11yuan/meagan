              memories of us walking around the park, holding hands, and just being silly.
              i loved how you made me feel like a kid again, and how you always made me laugh.

              building things and advancing in minecraft is also so fun and is cool to see how our world progressed overtime.
              roblox's mini games are also fun and we always have a good laugh when we play them.
              dress to impress is so fun and i love how we can be creative with our outfits and judge others together lol.
