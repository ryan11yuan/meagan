        <p>you made the lines for the rides something i was looking forward to. 
            i loved going to wonderland with you because it was those small chats and walks around the park and to vaughan mills that i cherished.
            memories of us walking around the park, holding hands, and just being silly.
            i loved how you made me feel like a kid again, and how you always made me laugh.

        <p>your sense of humour shines in our texts. 
            we always talk about the stupidest things and i love how we can be so silly together.

            it shows that we are committed to each other and that we are in this together.
            this also reminds me of our park dates and how we would go to parks near me and then go to parks near you.
            i love that we can be comfortable with each other's presence and not feel awkward or obligated to talk.

            its so warming and cute. 
            your facial expressions are also really telling of how you feel and i love the transparancy it gives

        <p>this date was so special because i think i had a good plan we followed and the grafitti did not disappoint either.
            our dates in toronto & walking in the night are so special to me.
            from being in toronto together during the reference library trip, to the UofT tour, to the grafitti date, to the aquarium date, and other scattered ones, i've never gotten bored of it.
            sight seeing is something that i usually find boring, but with you, it was so fun.

            playing games has been a rollercoaster. 
            now, i understand how you like to play games and i've learnt to appreciate it and enjoy it with you.
            you are my favourite person to play with.
            i love how we can be competitive and silly at the same time when we play trivia on discord or jklm.
            building things and advancing in minecraft is also so fun and is cool to see how our world progressed overtime.
            roblox's mini games are also fun and we always have a good laugh when we play them.
            dress to impress is so fun and i love how we can be creative with our outfits and judge others together lol.
            i still am the best tho at all of them tho... lol.

        <h2>facetime</h2>
        <p>talking to you on facetime and just having stray conversations is the best because i get to see your beautiful sexy face and talk to you without being in person.
            i love how you give me the hauls you get from shopping or from your mom shopping.
            i love how you always show me your outfits and i also love looking at you when you don't have much or any makeup on.
            your natural beauty is so stunning.

            i loved how you put your arms on my shoulders and how we were swaying to the music.
            i loved the way you looked at me and the way that we both resonated to the song cuz i got feelings for u.
